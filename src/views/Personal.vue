    <p>My roots are actually from a tiny, yet proudly tech-savy country of Estonia. It's a land of Skype, TransferWise, e-voting from a cold tub and best rye bread your tastebuds can hope for.

However, as fate had it, I moved to Switzerland to follow my heart in the summer of 2019. I live here now with my husband and our two felines, a perfect stereotypical family of "crazy cat people". A mandatory picture of them both below, as they would loudly protest at being left out. (Don't worry, the cat in the middle picture is in perfect health. The weirdo simply likes to sleep with his eyes open)</p>

<p>Sometimes you can find me in Poland, in a castle of Czocha with a hundred other LARPing enthusiasts. Running around in pointy hats and shouting spells is undoubtedly a great way to escape the routine and inject some magic in your life. You need only ask and I can talk for hours about the mayhem that has taken place in that castle.

I named one of our cats Leeroy Jenkins as a tribute to my World of Warcraft raiding days.
6 cups of coffee per day. This is the way.
Harry Potter and Witcher franchises have my heart
I'm at my happiest when I'm elbow deep in some DIY project or a good book.
Biggest money pit lately has been boardgames. Everdell collector's editions and Gloomhaven. I could sit up for hours crafting tiny components and painting miniatures. You can see some of my work here!</p>
