    <p>My roots are actually from a tiny, yet proudly tech-savy country of Estonia. It's a land of Skype, TransferWise, e-voting from a cold tub and best rye bread.

In 2019 I followed my heart to Switzerland. I live here now with my husband and our two felines and we're pretty much what you'd envision "crazy cat people" to be like. A mandatory picture of them both below, as they would loudly protest at being left out. (Don't worry, the cat in the middle picture is in perfect health. The weirdo simply likes to sleep with his eyes open)</p>

<p>Before Covid-19 restricted travel you could sometimes find me in Poland, in a castle of Czocha with a hundred other LARPing enthusiasts. Running around in pointy hats and shouting spells is undoubtedly a great way to escape the routine and inject some magic in your life. You need only ask and I can talk for hours about the mayhem that has taken place in that castle.

  <li>I named one of our cats Leeroy Jenkins as a tribute to my World of Warcraft raiding days.</li>
  <li>Harry Potter and Witcher franchises have my heart.</li>
  <li>I'm at my happiest when I'm elbow deep in some DIY project or a good book.</li>
  <li>Nerdy side in my adores boardgames. Current favourite is Everdell. I could sit up for hours crafting tiny components and painting miniatures.</li>
