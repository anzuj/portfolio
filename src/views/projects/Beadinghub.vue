        <h4>Goal</h4>
       Create an app to easily sort and manage beading
        patterns instead of a huge Google Drive folder that didn't offer enough organising methods.

        <ul>
          <li>
             Firebase. I wanted easy sign-on with Google authentication and also to upload PDFs and images
            when needed.
          </li>

          <li>
            Quasar. It's good to have multiple JS frameworks under one's belt! I chose to build this
            app with Quasar + Vite to reduce the bundle size and enhance compiling speed compared to
            webpack.
          </li>
          <li>VueJS 3. Before I've primarily maintained VueJS 2 apps, so this was a chance to get comfortable with Vue 3 class component syntax. It took a bit of time to get used to, but by the end of the project I definitely saw the benefits of being able to organize component code in a more logical sequence.</li>

          <li>
            JS Promises. It was important to check multiple things when creating a new pattern that
            may also include multiple uploads. It was necessary to create a good util function that
            handles multiple API calls allowing me to only upload once the preliminary tasks are
            done.
          </li>
